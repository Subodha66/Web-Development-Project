<h1>Community</h1>
<p>Delish Dining is committed to extending good energy and good will beyond our restaurant and back into the community. Our team seeks out partnerships with national hunger 
relief outfits and local charitable organizations whose mission aligns with our vision.

Donation Requests? Please email info@delishsnyc.com

Our charitable giving and community investment is dedicated to a few areas that connect most with us all, including hunger relief, neighborhood organizations, and city parks. 

Unfortunately, we may not be able to support every cause even though our team believes in the mission. Thank you for thinking of Delish Dining as a partner who can make a positive impact on your cause.</p>
