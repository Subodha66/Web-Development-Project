<h1>Our Story</h1>

<div style="padding:0px 150px;">

<p>Delish Dining is a nostalgic New York restaurant and wine bar in the heart of the West Village. The vision of husband-and-wife co-founders Nick Anderer and Natalie Johnson, 
Delish Dining thoughtfully reimagines NYC's rich culinary history through comforting, eclectic American cuisine with deep European influences. 
The restaurant's design evokes the warmth and casual elegance of the quintessential New York restaurants and bars that serve as our inspiration, updated for today. </p>


<p>The menu spotlights a seasonal selection of salads, vegetables, and NY-harvested shellfish. Seafood, chops, and side dishes celebrate iconic recipes from a bygone era, 
along with a variety of house-made pastas. Wine is paramount to the Delish Dining experience, with a 550+ bottle-deep list, and upwards of 20 by-the-glass selections gracing 
the menu at all times. A parade of spirit-forward, craft cocktails improve upon the watering holes of days gone by, as do an edited collection of beers from local brewmasters.</p>


<p>Delish Dining sits on a charming block in a landmarked 1850s Greek-revival style building, and the restaurant’s name pays tribute to Nick's great, great grandfather, 
whose emigration to New York City in the late 1800s paved the way for a line of butchers, bakers, and restaurateurs. The lovingly-appointed space features rich mahogany woodwork, 
beautiful wrought-iron windows, vintage tableware hand-selected by the team, dramatic florals by Terre Studio, and a series of still life paintings the duo commissioned 
from Georgian artist Vitali Dvali. A shaded sidewalk patio adds to the experience when the warm weather returns. </p>

<p>We hope to welcome you soon.</p>

<h1>About Nick & Natalie</h1>

<p>Nick Anderer is the Executive Chef and Co-Founder of Anton’s, alongside his wife and Co-Founder Natalie Johnson, who oversees the Beverage Program and Service. 
Together the two work hand-in-hand to further the restaurant’s vision, humble-yet-informed service, and a beverage and culinary program that honors the past while remaining 
firmly rooted in the present. Wine is paramount to the Delish Dining experience, and together Nick and Natalie obsessively pore over the food menu and beverage offerings to ensure 
each element works in service of the other. The pair met while working together at Danny Meyer’s Union Square Hospitality Group, Nick as Executive Chef and Managing Partner 
at both Maialino and Marta, and Natalie as a Sommelier. </p>

<p>Nick’s culinary discipline is anchored in an appreciation for carefully-sourced ingredients, seasonality, comfort, and a from-the-heart approach to cooking. A native New Yorker,
 Nick began his culinary career working at The Water Club and Babbo, before spending a year cooking in Rome and Milan. From there, Nick joined the kitchen team of Gramercy Tavern
 where he served as Sous Chef to Tom Colicchio, and later Executive Sous Chef to Mike Anthony. Overall, Nick spent 15 notable years in leadership across Union Square Hospitality 
Group restaurants - Gramercy Tavern, Maialino and Marta. </p>

<p>It was during his time at Gramercy Tavern that Nick’s deep appreciation for seasonal vegetables, and the farmers that grow them, took shape. From there, he went on to open two 
flagship Italian restaurants - Maialino (2009) and Marta (2014) - serving as Executive Chef and Managing Partner for both. Both restaurants separately garnered widespread praise,
 and each earned Two Stars from the New York Times under his leadership. In addition to numerous media accolades, Chef Nick is a two-time James Beard “Best Chef, New York City” 
semifinalist (2014, 2015), and has appeared as a guest chef and guest judge on various food television shows. </p>      

<p>Natalie believes wine service should be accessible, relatable, and fun. At Anton's, she facilitates tasting and discovery through Delish Dining meticulously developed, 550+ bottle deep 
list and a truly inspired, generous by-the-glass program. Natalie oversees a cocktail list that celebrates thoughtfully-conceived cocktails anchored in the classics, as well as an 
edited collection of beers ranging from local artisan brewers to international favorites. Natalie initially moved to NYC to pursue her love of restaurants as a line cook at Jim 
Lahey’s Co. in Chelsea. Prior to opening Delish Dining, Natalie served as the Beverage Director of Loring Place, a beloved Greenwich Village restaurant from Chef Dan Kluger. 
Natalie created the opening wine list and later managed the entire Beverage operation for the restaurant, including the full Wine and Cocktail program. Natalie previously 
worked in the Front-of-House teams in several acclaimed restaurants with celebrated wine programs across the country, including Frasca (Boulder, CO), Sorella (NYC), Otto (NYC), 
and Marta (NYC). In 2019, Natalie was recognized as a “Rising Star Sommelier” by Star Chefs. </p>
